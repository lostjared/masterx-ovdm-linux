# masterx-ovdm-linux

This was the site project for lostsidedead.com from 2008. It was written
to try and create a GUI environment for Python. It uses Boost Python and has
a custom python shell and API for manipulating the environment. 


To compile for Linux first you need:


SDL, Boost Python, Python 2.7 


and compile the following libs from my github page: http://github.com/lostjared
and install them to /usr/local


libmx 
libmasc
mxl


This was a learning experience and I had fun writing this program.
I was not as good at using Autoconf/Automake so the scripts are not as good as they could be

Just sharing this with you for fun.

Oh the user name / password for the login is:

This project was developed for lostsidedead.com in 2008, aiming to create a graphical user interface environment for Python. It incorporates Boost Python, featuring a custom Python shell and an API for environment manipulation.

For Linux compilation, the prerequisites are:

Development tools like libtool, autotools (including autoconf, automake, etc.), gcc, g++, libstdc++
Libraries such as SDL, Boost Python, and Python 2.7
Debian users can prepare their system with the following command:


	sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-stretch-dev autoconf automake libtool libboost-python-dev python2.7 gcc g++ libboost-all-dev git libjpeg8-dev

Additionally, compile and install the following libraries from my GitHub page: http://github.com/lostjared to /usr/local:
libmx
libmasc
mxl

This project was both a learning journey and a source of enjoyment. My skills with Autoconf/Automake were still developing at the time, so the scripts might not be as refined as possible.
I'm sharing this for entertainment and to showcase what I've worked on.
